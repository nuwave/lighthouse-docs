These are the docs for Lighthouse, a GraphQL server for Laravel.

**For more information, head over [to the main project](https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse)**
**or take a look at the [documentation website](https://lighthouse-php.com/)**

The docs are built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Contribute to the docs

1. Fork the project
1. Create a new branch
1. Make changes to the code
1. Commit with a concise title line and a few more lines detailing the change
1. Open a PR detailing your changes

### Setup

You can build and view the docs locally.
You either need `yarn`/`npm` or `docker` installed.

First, go ahead and `git clone` this repo (or your fork) and `cd` in the project root.

#### Docker

    docker-compose up -d

#### Node

    cd website
    yarn
    yarn run start

### Tag a new version

Only feature releases get a new docs version, so we do not tag the docs as `1.2.3`, just `1.2` does suffice.

    yarn run version x.y
